- 👋 Hi, I’m @yplebedev!
- 👀 I’m interested in modding and coding! I work in Source and make occasional MC mods (Mostly texture packs and var edits of shaders)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and GLSL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on random GoldSRC/S1/S2/MC mods.
- 📫 How to reach me (oredered by how often i check it): 
-     Discord: SomeCatEyeLink#3640 (DM me, I will accept frend requests but I will unfriend after some time, friends lists have a purpose)
      Steam: SCaELs | #VaccinatorIsTooOP (*can* and *will* change, but you will generally see SCaELs and SomeCatEyeLink in there. This is my main account, I don't have "trading accounts" n such)
      E-Mail: (I barely check it) yplebdev@gmail.com
