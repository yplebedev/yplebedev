- 👋 Hi, I’m @yplebedev (aka SCaELs, BFB in in my small community)!
- 👀 I’m interested in modding and coding! I'm a 3D artist (houdini, blender, and S3DD, postfx in aps) as well as an ex- Source engine modder and make occasional MC mode with fabric API.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RFX/HLSL/GLSL, Java, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collab on much, unless I reach out myself
- 📫 How to reach me (oredered by how often I check it): 
-     Discord: scaels (DM me, I will accept frend requests but I will unfriend after some time, friends lists have a purpose)
      Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/SCaELs/ (you'll generally see SCaELs and SomeCatEyeLink in there. This is my main account, I don't have "trading accounts" n such)
      E-Mail: (I barely check it) yplebdev@gmail.com
